## The objective of this tutorial is to understand the applications of constant Volume simulations and how to modify simulations (specifically the mdp file of each simulation) to have this feature.



+ Constant volume simulations are the standard for  most simulations unless your instructor says otherwise.

+ The mdp file has to be opened with a text-viewer and then editted.

+ In front of the option "pcouple" there has to be "no" and the option "Pcoupletype" there has to be "semiisotropic". Also, other variables should not be changed.

 the "compressibility" option has to be modified and the second term has to be zero ( N  N). N is usually 3e-5

+ the "ref_p" option has to be 1 1 ( which is the standard for most mdp file).





*You can look these options up in the mdp file in this folder.*
