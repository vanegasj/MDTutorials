## The objective of this tutorial is to understand the applications of constant pressure simulations and how to modify simulations (specifically the mdp file of each simulation) to have this feature.


+ Constant pressure is used for??


+ To have constant pressure, the mdp file of the mdrun ( the second run) has to be modified.

+ The mdp file has to be opened with a text-viewer and then editted.

+ In front of the option "pcouple" there has to be "Parrinello-Rahman" and the option "Pcoupletype" there has to be "semiisotropic". Also, other variables should not be changed.

+ the "compressibility" option has to be ( N  N). N is usually 3e-5

+ the "ref_p" option has to be (1.0 1.0)


*You can look these options up in the mdp file in this folder.*
