... To graph the stress tensor of a monolayer/bilayer, we need to use a modified version of gromacs called gromacs_LS.

1.First we need to load the program:

'''
module load gromacs_ls/2016.3-gcc
'''

2.Secondly, we need to run the normal version of the simulation ( the specifics of this part can be found in other tutorials depending on the type of simulation[bilyaer vs monolayre, constant pressure vs constant volume] that is being run).
'''
qsub Run_md_gibbs.sh
'''

3.Thirdly, now that we have generated a complete trajectory, we have to center the system so that we have consistent frames across the bilayer/monolayer.


'''
qsub center_traj.sh
'''

4.Now, the gromacs_LS module has to be used to create an alternative tpr file ( preferably called rerun.tpr). The following commands have to be used:


'''

module load gromacs-ls/2016.3-gcc (if not used earlier)

gmx_LS grompp -f *.mdp -c *.pdb -n index.ndx -o rerun.tpr
'''

*(IMPORTANT NOTE: The mdp file for this operation is different from the mdp of other operations and the gmx_LS command will only work with the appropriate mdp file)*



5.Finally, the centered frames and the rerun.tpr file  have to be used to generate a final xvg file that illustrates the stress across teh monolayer/bilayer in  the form of a graph.

'''
qsub run_locals.sh
'''

6.You have to then compile are .dat files into one .xvg file:

'''
tensortools -f *.dat0 --prof z -o localstress.xvg
'''

7.After this phase, you can plot the resulting xvg file and observe a graph of the stress tensor of your simulation. you can use the plot command outside of the cluster if you have it on your system, if not, ask your instructor and install it on your system a convinient way to visualize graphs.
